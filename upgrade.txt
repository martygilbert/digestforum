=== 2.8 ===
 * The following functions have all been marked as deprecated. Many of
   these have not been supported in many releases and should not be relied
   upon:
     digestforum_count_unrated_posts
     digestforum_tp_count_discussion_read_records
     digestforum_get_user_discussions
     digestforum_tp_count_digestforum_posts
     digestforum_tp_count_digestforum_read_records
     digestforum_get_open_modes
     digestforum_get_child_posts
     digestforum_get_discussion_posts
     digestforum_get_ratings
     digestforum_get_tracking_link
     digestforum_tp_count_discussion_unread_posts
     digestforum_convert_to_roles
     digestforum_tp_get_read_records
     digestforum_tp_get_discussion_read_records
     digestforum_user_enrolled
     digestforum_user_can_view_post
 * The following functions have been deprecated and replaced. Please see the phpdoc for each on the new function to use instead:
   * digestforum_is_subscribed
   * digestforum_subscribe
   * digestforum_unsubscribe
   * digestforum_subscribed_users
   * digestforum_is_forcesubscribed
   * digestforum_forcesubscribe
   * digestforum_get_forcesubscribed
   * digestforum_get_subscribed_digestforums
   * digestforum_get_optional_subscribed_digestforums
   * digestforum_get_potential_subscribers
 * External function mod_digestforum_external::get_digestforum_discussions has been deprecated.
   Use mod_digestforum_external::get_digestforum_discussions_paginated instead.

=== 2.6 ===

* The file post_form.php should not be included, the class it contained has
  been moved so that it can benefit from autoloading.
* The function digestforum_shorten_post() has been deprecated. It was doing a poor
  job of shortening digestforum post text and the shorten_text() function does a
  much better job.
* The constant DFORUM_TRACKING_ON has been deprecated and replaced by
  DFORUM_TRACKING_FORCED. The value between them is maintained, so they are
  interchangeable, but code should migrate to the new name.

=== 2.5 ===

The function digestforum_check_throttling has been changed so that a warning object is returned when a user has reached the 'Post threshold for warning' or
'Post threshold for blocking' setting, rather than echoing this on screen. This allows the warning to be moved inside the post form as it can be added
as a HTML element, where it is more noticeable. False is returned if there is no need to warn, or restrict the user from posting - see MDL-39182.

=== 2.3.5, 2.4.2 ===

* mod/digestforum:allowforcesubscribe capability will be forcefully assigned to frontpage role, as it was mistakenly missed off
when the capability was initially created. If you don't want users with frontpage role to get digestforum (with forcesubscribe) emails,
then please remove this capability for frontpage role.
