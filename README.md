digestdigestforum
===========

A fork of the Moodle digestforum code, this digestforum will require that all posts be added to a digest, 
regardless of the users' settings.

CHANGE FOR DIGEST_31 - Forked the Moodle 3.1 digestforum code and re-digest-digestforumed it. At least I'm attempting to do so. All previous branches were based off the Moodle 2.5 digestforum code.
